                <h2>Robin</h2>
                <p><i>Robin is the alias of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.
                     The character was originally created by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson, to serve as a junior counterpart and the sidekick to the superhero Batman.
                      As a team, Batman and Robin have commonly been referred to as the Caped Crusaders and the Dynamic Duo.
                       The character's first incarnation, Dick Grayson, debuted in <a href = "Comics.html">Detective Comics.</a>
                        Conceived as a way to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman titles.</i></p>

                <h2>Alfred Pennyworth</h2>
                <p><i>Alfred Thaddeus Crane Pennyworth is Bruce Wayne's valet at Wayne Manor.
                     He knows that Bruce is secretly Batman and aids him.
                      Alfred Pennyworth, after a varied career, was employed as the Wayne family valet when Bruce Wayne's parents were killed.
                       Alfred raised the young orphan and reluctantly aided him in his quest to become Batman.
                        His many skills—ranging from cooking to medicine—make him Batman's staunchest ally,
                         along with a formal demeanor that grounds the Dark Knight and deflects those who might otherwise suspect Batman's true identity.</i></p>
